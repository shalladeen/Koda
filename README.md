Welcome to Koda! ðŸš€

I created Koda as a persoanl project to hone my skills in effective Web App Development. I've been wanting to create a productivity app for a while now because, I wanted to create someting that would act as my own personal toolkit for staying organized, motivated, and productive. Created with React and Chakra UI, Koda allows me to manage tasks, events, and notes seamlessly, all while gamifying productivity to keep myself motivated.

Features:

Task Management: Stay on top of your to-do list with intuitive task organization and prioritization.
Event Tracking: Keep track of important events and deadlines effortlessly.
Note Taking: Capture ideas, thoughts, and reminders in a centralized space.
Productivity Gamification: Earn achievements and rewards for maintaining focus and productivity.
Customization: Tailor Koda to your workflow, ensuring it fits seamlessly into your daily routine.
